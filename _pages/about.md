<!-- Welcome to my e-home! -->


ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ, नमस्ते, Hi there,
===

I'm a graduate student at the School of Computing Science of the Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Burnaby. I work as a Research Assistant at the [Medical Image Analysis Lab](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) of SFU under the supervision of Prof. [Ghassan Hamarneh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=61DdlkAAAAAJ). My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning, particularly on images and graphs.

I started my Masters (Thesis-based M.Sc.) in the Fall of 2019. Before joining SFU, I did my undergrad at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I was fortunate to have interned at the University of Regina and Manipal Dot Net Pvt. Ltd. during this period.
