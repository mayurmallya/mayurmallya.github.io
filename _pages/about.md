ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ, नमस्ते, Hi there,
---

I'm a graduate student in the School of Computing Science at the Simon Fraser University (SFU), Burnaby. I work as a Research Assistant at the [Medical Image Analysis Lab](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) of SFU under the supervision of Prof. [Ghassan Hamarneh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=61DdlkAAAAAJ). My research interests lie in the application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis.

I started my Masters (Thesis-based M.Sc.) in the Fall of 2019. Before joining SFU, I did my undergrad at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I was fortunate to have interned at the University of Regina and Manipal Dot Net Pvt. Ltd. during this period.
